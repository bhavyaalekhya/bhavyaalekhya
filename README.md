# Hi there! I'm **Bhavya Alekhya** 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** experienced in building scalable, high-availability systems across frontend, backend, cloud, and AI/ML. I enjoy designing intuitive user interfaces, architecting reliable systems, and applying multimodal AI techniques to solve real-world problems.

My work spans enterprise dashboards, microservices, distributed systems, CI/CD pipelines, and research in vision-language modeling — including a publication at **NeurIPS 2024**.

## 🚀 What I Do

### **Frontend Engineering**
Building performant and accessible interfaces using **React, TypeScript, Redux, Tailwind, Material UI**  
- Reduced dashboard page render time by **30%**  
- Designed reusable UI components within a monorepo, reducing maintenance overhead by **25%**  
- Improved user flows, responsiveness, and accessibility across global systems  

### **Backend & Cloud Engineering**
Designing reliable APIs and distributed systems using **Node.js, Python, FastAPI, Flask**, powered by relational & NoSQL databases  
- Improved backend throughput by **25%** through API + database optimizations  
- Built event-driven pipelines using AWS Lambda  
- Deployed containerized microservices on **AWS EKS** and automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions & Jenkins  

### **AI/ML Research & Engineering**
Exploring multimodal reasoning, VLMs, and automation  
- Co-created **CaptainCook4D** (94.5 hours, 384 videos), published at **NeurIPS 2024**  
- Achieved **43.84% improvement** in zero-shot error recognition with prompt-ensembling (LLaMA, Video-LLaVA, TimeChat)  
- Built CUDA-accelerated ML inference pipelines for video understanding
